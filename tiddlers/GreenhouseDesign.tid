Here you see Google Earth's default view of existing greenhouse site (inside the redlined box), circa 2015.03.15 :

Using "History" feature in GEPro, we get this most recent image from 2019.07.16 -fuzzy, but sharp enough to see how half of the structure has been moved to create a shade tunnel on the terrace just below, which appears as a dark green rectangle to the NE (above right) of the polytunnel as it stands now:

From ground-level perspective, just outside south end of the greenhouse, here's how it stood as at 2020.02.01.  Notice the flowerpot standing on box at RH side of door, with an embedded humidity sensor, and the solar panel over top RH corner of door; that is the first iteration of our remote sensing system, soon to be implemented.

So that's the backstory up to now. As to design of new greenhouse, that is coming up... But meanwhile, there are 3 related resources i want to capture here, before i forget: 

* excellent [[article from Milkwood AU|https://www.milkwood.net/2020/05/04/making-a-mini-greenhouse-to-extend-your-growing-season/]] that pulls together a bunch of different greenhouse patterns;
* book: [[The Year-Roiund Solar Greenhouse|https://www.amazon.com/Year-Round-Solar-Greenhouse-Design-Net-Zero/dp/0865718245]], about how to build a net-zero energy greenhouse
* article: [[What's a Walpini|https://thehomestead.guru/whats-a-walipini-underground-greenhouses-101/]], about a lower-tech more traditional earth-sheltered way of achieving year-round climate control in the greenhouse.
