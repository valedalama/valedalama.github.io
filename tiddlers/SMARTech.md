!! What It's Not:
the most high-tech, big-data crunching, machine-learning driven, maximally roboticized "solution" under the sun;  in fact such a thing (if it existed) would be categorically ruled out.  

!! What It Is:

* S= data/tech-Sovereignty:
** users can decide what to do with own data
** no tech lock-in
* M= userMaintainable:
** routine procedures for operating the system and maintaining its flow of data are intuitive and minimally onerous to perform
** when problems arise: user can generally intervene to fix it
* A= Agile development:
** affirmative action for open-source
** also values agile working relationships, even with closed source developers
** antipattern: a black-box solution from an inaccessible/ unresponsive developer
* R= Regenerative impact on affected ecosystems:
** Ecological:
*** conserves natural resources
*** invests suplus in development of future resource base
** SocioEconomic:
*** creates opportunity for ALL those involved
*** antipattern: enslaves users and/or exploits developers, etc.
