As a test, a series of half-dozen paddocks were created, using our 20 "can√ßelas" (3m long hurdles) in a roughly square configuration... Which was later paced-off with GPS and mapped (using MeasureMap Pro on iPhone) as follows:

Each of these paddocks was grazed by our 20 sheep for 2 days, which led us to the week before Christmas... Then the pattern was continued until January 4, when the following drone image was shot:

This illustrates very clearly the paddock defintions, and also the recovery rate of grass -quite fast, given the combination of prolific rain and sun that prevailed through the period.
