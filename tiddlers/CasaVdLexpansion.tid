title: CasaVdLexpansion

In context of this AgroTourismProject, there is now an architectural project underway to expand Casa Vale da Lama from its existing footprint of ~700 m2 to ~2000 m2, with significant expansion of both accommodation and food service capacity, along with significant new facilities (e.g. all-seasons cover over pool, new spa and classroom/ convo-hall facilities) and significant qualitative improvements all around.
