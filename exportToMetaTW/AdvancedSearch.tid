title: AdvancedSearch

Besides the ubiquitous search widget, i've added the "Advanced Search" tool (magnifier icon, between control panel and save tools) in my toolbar. 

Also: TW developer Mario Pietch (aka pmario) has [[a YouTube channel|https://www.youtube.com/c/MarioPietsch]] w/ some interesting content, including these two items on [[advanced seach plus|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Agp0t53Ipo]] and [field search v0.2.2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRkttEULPw]], that last being a real power-plugin he's developed (one of many: see his wikilabs.github.io site, or [[this video that explains how to use it|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QwGUGckiwI]]).
