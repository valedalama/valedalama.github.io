The Google Map below shows the farm at center of screen- buffered by ~1km or so of context around it -and a cluster of POIs (Points Of Interest) than expand as you zoom in and click on them, in many cases to reveal a picture or few -most of them pretty old, ranging from 2013-2017, but still informative (if you don't see those POI bubbles, click the icon in upperLH corner of the map frame, and you can check the box to display POIs).
